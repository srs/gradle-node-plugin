# Installing

Installing the node-related plugins can be done in multiple ways. The easiest is to use the `plugins`-closure 
in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
plugins {
  id "com.moowork.node" version "1.3.1"
}
```

If you want to install all of the node-plugins (which is pretty uncommon), then write this:

```gradle
plugins {
  id "com.moowork.node" version "1.3.1"
  id "com.moowork.grunt" version "1.3.1"
  id "com.moowork.gulp" version "1.3.1"
}
```

You can also install the plugins by using the traditional Gradle way:

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    } 
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath "com.moowork.gradle:gradle-node-plugin:1.3.1"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.moowork.node'
```

In multi-project builds the plugin can be applied to the individual projects making use of it. By
further applying it to the root project, child project will make use of the root configuration
and share a download cache directory.
 

## Installing snapshots

If you want to install snapshot versions of this plugin, you can add the [OJO repository](http://oss.jfrog.org)
to your build:

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "http://oss.jfrog.org"
    } 
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath "com.moowork.gradle:gradle-node-plugin:1.4.0-SNAPSHOT"
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.moowork.node'
```
